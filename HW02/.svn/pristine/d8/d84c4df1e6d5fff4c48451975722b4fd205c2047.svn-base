Instructions for Ball World.

After launching the application, a window will appear. In the header, 
there will be three different containers; a text-box, a button labeled 
"Add Ball", and a button labeled "Clear Balls". The user can type the
type of ball that they wish to add into the text-box and then click the 
"Add Ball" button to add a ball of that type to the window. There are
three types of balls that may be added:
	balls.ColorChangingBall
	balls.SizeChangingBall
	balls.StraightBall. 
Clicking the "Clear Ball" button will remove all balls from the window.
